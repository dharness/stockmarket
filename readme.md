# Stock Market App - Mostly becasue I had to, but i still enjoyed it

I will admit, I only made this application because I had to for school. No body really has any use for it - and for that reason I lobbied hard to get the project changed. When my professor would not accomodate I lobbied for students to be allowed to use any front end MVC, in particular AngularJS. This too was denied and emberJS was used.

### The Need

As stated above - nobofy needs this. Do not clone it. Do not fork it. Do not download it.

## How to use this Project

It's all front end, but the datastores require a web server. On a mac, I like to run:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```



## Future Versions

I won't be maintaining this project. Feel free to do with it what you will. I will however, be agressively playing the stock market.
